# A sample repo to show project hieararchy.

This repo is used to define a project template for a cloud/cloud native project.
The definition is `Java` based but this can be extended for any other type of project.
A Jenkins like build job can switch based on the type of source folder provided. 
This can be a more of a convention than a configuration.
